# BagOfHolding
Thanks for downloading! 

This program is written in C# using Windows Forms. 
It's still a work in progress, but I've gotten plenty of practical use
out of it already, so feel free to use and modify it as much as you want.

It's pretty void of comments, and there's a few obvious features I 
have yet to add, but even so it's helped me maintain flow during my 
sessions quite a bit. 

If there's any sort of issues or comments you'd like to make, my
email is: Kronschnabel@live.com

I'm still a greenhorn, I'm interested in any and all feedback.
